# Program to record purchases of crypto. X dollars @ Y price results in
# Z coin ownership. E.g. $3500 when BTC is at 35000 = .1 BTC
# Date of purchase optional.

# Options in program will be to enter new purchases and review/modify/
# delete previously entered purchases

# Secondary function will pull current crypto value and calculate
# percentage increase and absolute value increase for each 
# entry

# Stretch goals include multiple choice crypto selection in
# order to use proper API to pull crypto value.

# example currency formats - requires float to convert to string
# print("{:.2f}".format(ledger_entry.get('Fiat amount purchased')))
# print("{:.2f}".format(buy_dollar))

# Initialize dictionary to record info
# Maybe change this process
ledger_entry= {}
