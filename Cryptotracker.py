# Program to record purchases of crypto. X dollars @ Y price results in
# Z coin ownership. E.g. $200 when BTC is at 4371.08 = .00164 BTC
# Date of purchase optional.

# Options in program will be to enter new purchases and review/modify/

# Secondary function will pull current crypto value and calculate
# percentage increase and absolute value increase for each 
# entry

#Stretch goals include multiple choice crypto selection in
#order to use proper API to pull crypto value.
